#divulge.js
###A lightweight plugin for lazy-triggering events when scrolling elements in view

Based on [Luis Almeidas Unveil](http://luis-almeida.github.io/unveil/), this plugin aims to simply fire a callback when elements are scrolled into view, giving the user the choice of action, whether it be lazy loading images, fetching additional data or simply show/hide elements.

## Installation

**In browser**
